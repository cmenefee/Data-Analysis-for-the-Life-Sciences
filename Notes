never ever share ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Normal workflow:
git diff         # see any changes you've made
git status       # see any files you've made changes to, any files not yet added to the project, and general state of things
git add <file>   # add a file (either the first time, or after making changes to it)
git commit       # actually record changes to your local repo from files you've done "git add" on
git pull         # update your local repo with any remote changes
git push         # push your changes up to github 

Got a workbench;
Got my raw materials, a datastore setup to workwith,
Got my software-suite/tool-bag all layed out,
Got all the folders I was working on updated
